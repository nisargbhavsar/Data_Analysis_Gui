Steps:

1) Before starting an analysis batch, load the calibration data.
	-Click "Load Calibration Data"
	-Clicking "Data Point" will give you the ability to choose two places in the data stream corresponding to a specific target.
	-Choose the data points in order of needle, then the targets (from left to right)
	-Verify the mean, standard deviation and differences in the table below the grid
	-After the target points have been selected, click "Data Point" one last time, the window will close
2) Load trial data
	-When loading, the trial number will come up on the top left hand side of the window for validation
3) Choose an appropriate resampling and filtering frequency
4) Plot the data by first choosing one of the three options (Raw Data, Resampled Data, Filtered Data)
5) Using the data cursor on the top left hand side of the window, locate the velocity peak in the z direction
6) Choose "Index Only" from the drop down menu on the lower left hand side of the window
7) Input a number slightly lower than the velocity peak (ie. 1.93 m/s -> 1.9) in the Index Velocity Edit Box on the right hand side of the window
8) Click extract kinematic variables
9) The extracted points can be moved using the slider
10) Select the point which needs to be moved from the drop down menu, the slider will now allow the point to be moved
11) Select either "Accept Trial" or "Reject Trial"
12) If step 7 did not recognize the appropriate peak, select "Respecify"
	-"Respecify" allows for two points to be selected on the velocity graph
	-Between the two points, the algorithm will look for the peak approach phase velocity
13) If selected "Accept Trial" / "Reject Trial" another trial can be loaded
